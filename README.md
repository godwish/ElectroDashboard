ElectroDashboard is a shortcut launcher.
It is built with Electron and allows you to easily and quickly manage your shortcuts.
You can organize related shortcuts into categories and place them wherever you like on the dashboard.

It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

However, due to the lack of a code-signing certificate, only Windows currently supports proper auto-updates.

As this is an early stage of development, we are focusing on Windows first, with Linux support planned in the future.

Thank you!
